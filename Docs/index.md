## Project Status

!!! warning "Project Shelved"
    This portfolio project was shelved in January 2026. I started a new position working with Meta's native SDK rather than OpenXR, making context-switching between the two SDKs impractical for continued development.
        
    These Documents were also generated by Claude Opus 4.5 based off of my existing MD Files and the Code I made in the project.
    I don't usually do this but I wanted to clean up the documents before shelving and don't have the time to do it properly myself.   

    This project was worked on from December 15th 2025 to January 31st 2026.

    See [Project Status](future/project-status.md) for what was completed and what was planned next.

## System Architecture

The project uses a layered architecture separating presentation, gameplay, events, and data concerns.

|:--------|:---------------|
| ScriptableObject Database | Generic `DatabaseBase<T>` with O(1) lookups |
| Event Bus | Type-safe ScriptableObject event channels |
| Object Pool | Unity ObjectPool with priority routing |
| Factory | UIToolkitFactory for consistent UI creation |
| Component | Modular enemy and weapon components |
