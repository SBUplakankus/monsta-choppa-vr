# 📘 The Monsta Choppa Repository

**A lot of this is AI Generated at the moment for placeholder info while I develop the game**

This folder contains high-level technical documentation for the Unity VR project **Monsta Choppa*.  
The goal of these documents is to explain **how systems are structured**, **why architectural decisions were made**, and **how different systems communicate**.

This project is built on top of Unity’s **XR Interaction Toolkit–based VR Template**, with custom systems layered on top to support **modular**, **event-driven**, and **data-driven** gameplay.
